Resources

The Project_UML.xml file contains the UML diagram for this project.
We are using Visual Paradigm's online tool to edit the diagram. 
Their website can be found here:

I created this diagram with no knowledge of how this application should function or how to use UML.
Please feel free to edit as needed.
